# Website-nav-bar

More practice. Based off of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yw9gBHE60E. Practicing with making top nav bars. Will likely finish this with a few linked pages that can be accessed via top 
nav bar. Will maybe work off this to incorporate some JS?! Who knows. 

Next evolution of this project is to work on adding a pretty logo (good practice with img, sizing, making a logo), adding - and using flexbox - for content on home page, and likley will add log in and sign up page. Probably will do some JS for form field validation that's somewhat interactive. IF I'm REALLY going after it maybe some database stuff for actually creating an account and storing credentials.
